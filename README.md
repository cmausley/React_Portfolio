# React Portfolio

## Description

For this project, I created a employee directory with React. This assignment required me to break up my application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

So in this app, the user is able to view their entire employee directory at once so that they have quick access to their information.

When the user loads the page, a table of employees renders.

The user can also sort the employees by name and date of birth.
